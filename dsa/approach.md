   - External sorting for large datasets.

5. **Variations**:
   - Top-down vs Bottom-up Merge Sort.
   - Merge Sort for Linked Lists (using recursion to merge).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - Empty input.
   - Array with one element.
   - Array with all identical elements.

The questions in your interview will likely focus on assessing your **coding ability**, **problem-solving skills**, and **knowledge of data structures and algorithms**. Here's a detailed breakdown of the types of questions you might encounter:

---

### **1. Coding Problems**
Expect questions that test your ability to write **working code**. These will usually involve:

   - Find the maximum/minimum in an array.
   - Check if a string is a palindrome.

2. **Medium**:
   - Find the longest substring without repeating characters.  
   - Implement a sorting algorithm (e.g., merge sort or quick sort).
   - Solve the "two sum" problem (return indices of two numbers that sum up to a target).

3. **Hard**:
   - Implement an LRU Cache.
   - Solve a problem with constraints on time/space complexity (e.g., "Find the median of a stream of integers").
